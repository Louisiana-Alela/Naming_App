        <h2><strong><em>About</em></strong></h2>
        <p><em><strong> In Ghana, an Outdooring is the traditional naming ceremony for infants. <br>
            This also symbolized that the child was likely to survive hence was given a name. <br>
            In addition to the day name, Ghanians frequently give children a name of an elder relative, either living or deceased. <br>
            Duding this ceremony, male infants would be circumcised and female infants would have their ears pierced. <br>
            Outdooring serves as a symbolic ceremony and celebration of birth. <br>
            The ceremony takes place with the relatives and close friends attending. <br>
            Akan is the traditional naming ceremony for infants in Ghanian culture. <br>
            Here are some of the Ghanian Akan names; <br></strong></strong></em>
