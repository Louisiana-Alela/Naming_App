            <p><em>In Ghana, an Outdooring is the traditional naming ceremony for infants. <br>
            Traditionally, this ceremony occurs <strong>eights days after the child is born </strong>where parents bring their newborn "outdoors" for the first time and give the child a day name. <br>
            This also symbolized that the child was likely to survive hence was given a name. <br>
            In addition to the day name, Ghanians frequently give children a name of an elder relative, either living or deceased. <br>
            Duding this ceremony, male infants would be circumcised and female infants would have their ears pierced. <br>
            Outdooring serves as a symbolic ceremony and celebration of birth. <br>
            The ceremony takes place with the relatives and close friends attending. <br>
            Akan is the traditional naming ceremony for infants in Ghanian culture. <br>
            Here are some of the Ghanian Akan names; <br></em></p>
